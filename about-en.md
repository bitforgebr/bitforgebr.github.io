<p>The creation of a company focused in complex, low level, high performance software came up slowly through the progressive meeting of the programmers Gianni Rossi, BitForge IPTV founder, <a href="http://www.1bit.com.br">Rodrigo Strauss</a>, <a href="http://www.intelitrader.com.br">Intelitrader</a> founder, and <a href="http://www.caloni.com.br">Wanderley Caloni</a>, one of the founders of C/C++ Brazil and known in the Information Security and Financial Market industries.</p>

<p>Throught the sinergy of these high skill professionals, each one with more than fifteen years of experience in a myriad of development areas, is that BitForge Tecnologia was born.</p>

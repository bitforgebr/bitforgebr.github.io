<h2>IPTV</h2>
<p>We are well regarded in the IPTV industry as firmware specialists in many product segments such as IPTV,
corporate TV, Digital-Signage and OTT dongles. We have the experience in developing solutions for the whole
network, from the head-end to the set-top-box, as well as content delivery and mobile media apps, creating
therefore complete product ecosystems for our clients and partners. Our experience and success stories include
many chip-set suppliers such as <a href="http://www.alitech.com/" target="_blan">Ali</a>, <a href="http://www.st.com" target="_blank">STMicroelectronics</a>,

<h2>Manufacturing</h2>
<p>We have experience in industrial automation, using our propriety framework, to ensure total control
and auditing of an assembly line. All of that done in C/C++ to ensure the solution has great performance
and minimal impact on the assembly line's speed, but guaranteeing ease of operation and intuitive controls,
to reduce implementation costs, retraining and operation failures.  </p>

<h2>Start-ups</h2>
<p>If you have a great idea for a start-up, but doesn't have the experience with software
development, or is concerned with the costs and risks associated with building your own team,
we can help you develop your product while creating and training your own team. We have
the knowledge and experience with creating scalable infrastructure to rapidly take your
idea to market, while still being future-proof when it takes-off. Our model is to create
a low cost MVP so your start-up can attract the necessary capital or integrate with suitable
beta testers.</p>

Our experience with operating systems, starts from the BIOS, to booting in 16-bit Assembly, up until the
management GUI.</p>

<h2>Embedded Development</h2>
<p>If your product needs to be developed in a short amount of time, use very few resources and run 24/7, we
can help thanks to our extensive experience with C/C++ and Assemble for embedded Linux platforms. Whether
that means using and customizing off-the-shelf platforms - such as Beagle* boards, Raspberry Pi, etc - or
creating customized software drivers for specialized hardware, we have the tools to help.</p>

<h2>Mobile</h2>
